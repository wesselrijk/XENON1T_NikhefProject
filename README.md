# XENON1T_NikhefProject

This is the working repository used for the final project of the 'Nikhef Project' course of the 'Physics and Astronomy' Master's programme of the Universiteit van Amsterdam for 2019/20 semester 2 period 2 & 3.

## Goal
The goal of the final project is to write a data reconstruction package for the XENON1T dark matter experiment. This shouldinclude the actual reconstruction program, (Geant4) simulations, notebooks and a final report, written jointly by you all. You will build upon the start you made with theXAMS data. The explicit goal is to not only make and describe yourXENON1T reconstruction, but do so as a collaboration –just like the experimental collaborations are doing! 

## Final Report
You will write one final reporttogether and describe what youdid and especially also the outcomes of the reconstruction, simulation etc. Describe what workedand what did not workas well. It should be a “scientific document”in thestyle of a longish scientific article or thesis. To give youan indication on the length: past Nikhef Project reports with a similar number of students were 60-100 pages. The report should also have a section where each one of youdoes some reflection, and gives a short description ofyourcontribution to the report and the overall project. The report should be delivered to me by July 1 at the latest. 

## Notes
- Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5edcf53ba2ae530001f318fb
- A generic '.gitignore' file has been provided that ignores some basic stuff, feel free to edit it when necessary.
- Use library to share some nice and useful papers/books, or use it for funny memes. But be wary of file sizes.
